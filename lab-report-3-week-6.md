# Week 6 Lab Report
## Streamlining ssh Configuration

>### Adding the config file

`config` was initially made by running  `touch config` in the terminal while in the .ssh directory.

>### Editing the config file by using the TextEdit application (Default text editor for MacOS)

Double clicking the config file caused the TextEdit application to run. I used it to write what is seen above.

## Setup Github Access from ieng6
>### The public key's location on Github is shown below:
![Image](/L3_screenshots/sshgit.png)

The private and public key pair was generated by following Github's tutorial on how to create a new SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent. To upload it to GitHub I ran "cat id_ed255519.pub" while in the .ssh folder, then highlighted and copied the contents from the terminal.

>### Running git commands to push a change (in the repo used for the skill demonstration):
![Image](/L3_screenshots/changepush.png)

Here I have created a blank file in the directory `skill-demo-real` named `change.java`. It was first added and committed to the staging area, then pushed to the origin. Before I could do this however, I had to run the command `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ohuynh21/skill-demo-real.git` as I couldn't push when the origin was set using the https: path (as I used the https link when I cloned it).

## Copy whole directories with scp -r
>### Copying the markdown-parse directory:

*Note: Because I am recursively copying all files in markdownparse's directory, all the github files are transferred as well. This explains there are a bunch of random letters and numbers being transferred to ieng6 in addition to the core files.


>### Running the tests on ieng6:

Running "make test" allows me to compile and run `MarkdownParse.java` and its tester file `MarkdownParseTest.java` via the Makefile. (This was created in lab 6)
